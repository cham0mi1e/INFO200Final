# INFO200Final
In this project, we aimed to answer the following question:  
*Is there a significant relationship between ADHD diagnosis and race, and has it changed between 2000 and 2020? Could household income also have a correlation with both race and ADHD diagnosis?*  
Team member Hannah has ADHD and has done some research into the subject, and the other group members all know people close to them who also have ADHD, so it is a very relevant topic. Especially considering that going without an ADHD diagnosis can be detrimental to a child or person's well-being, it is vital for healthcare professionals to consider the impacts their unconscious (or conscious) biases can have, so we hope to highlight any disparities between races in ADHD diagnosis and why that might be, such as household income. Below is a graph of the percentage of each race's population with each ADHD diagnosis status comparing the years 2000 and 2020.

From this examination, we concluded that although there is not one perfect trend that fits all races for a relationship between income and ADHD diagnosis rates, as the rates of ADHD grew from 2000 to 2020, lower income groups were more likely to also have a larger increase in ADHD. This study opened our eyes to the fact that not all racial and income groups have equal access to ADHD information and screening within their communities, one of the side effects being that we were not able to conduct as precise of an investigation as we wanted.
